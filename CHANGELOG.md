# Changelog

This the Changelog file for the shellerate project. 'shellerate' is pun between
'shell' and 'scellerato', the Italian word for 'wicked'.

'shellerate' is a shellcode generation framework born from the assignments I
took for the SecurityTube Linux Assembly Expert certification process.

You can feature custom encoders, custom crypters, polymorphism and all stuff I
learnt in the SLAE certification process.
